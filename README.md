## Introduction

Welcome to the respository for a personal project of mine, in this project, I've followed the below Youtube video and have created a Calculator within the web browser.

### The Why?

    The reason for doing this is to supplement my learning on the EdX Front End Dev bootcamp, and to develop upon my current learnings.

## Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

* **index.html:** The main HTML file containing the structure of the calculator.
* **style.css:** The CSS file for styling the calculator.
* **script.js:** The JavaScript file with the logic for calculator operations.
